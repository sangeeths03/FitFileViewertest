Getting started

The idea for this template is taken from the [GitHub docs CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with this project, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the Pull Request template so that we can easily review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. Be ready to respond to any comments we might have.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
